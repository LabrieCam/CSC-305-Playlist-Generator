## Market Observations for Playlist Generator App

### Observation 1: Cameron Labrie
**Observation Statement:**  
Users under 25 years old predominantly use Spotify and Apple Music, and they highly value the ability to edit and generate playlists, as well as receive song recommendations.

**Supporting Data:**  
- The majority of respondents are under 25 years old and use Spotify or Apple Music.
- Many users express a high level of satisfaction with their current music streaming service.
- Commonly requested features include editing generated playlists, generating playlists without a prompt, and recommending songs for existing playlists.
- Users frequently discover new music through social media, friends, and in-app recommendations.

**Team Action (if any):**  

Consider enhancing playlist generation features by incorporating more personalized recommendations and editing capabilities. Focus on integrating social media trends and friend-based recommendations to improve user satisfaction and engagement.

### Observation 2: Andrew Langille
**Observation Statement:**
It is clear from our research that it will be very important that the app can generate reliably good playlists based on genre and mood.

**Supporting Data:**  
- 68.9% of users who took our survey stated genre and mood as being the most important filters for playlist generation
- It was stated in some comments that generated playlists typically cannot accurately match a mood which makes that filter more important to look into.

**Team Action (if any):**  
The team will have to go through a lot of testing to ensure that we generate playlists users will enjoy.

### Observation 3: Venthai Mao
**Observation Statement:**
Features such editing generated playlists and song recommendations are by far the most interested features ranked by users from the survey.

**Supporting Data:**  
- 79.3% is the highest score for "songs recommendation" feature.
- 72.4% is the 2nd highest score for editing generated playlists feature.

Currently 3 other features are tied with eachother (tied 51.7% score): 
- Ability to copy a playlist to another streaming service.
- Daily playlists based on specified interests.
- Ability to fully make your own playlist.

**Team Action (if any):**  
We listed 9 features, the team will most likely have to shorten least wanted features and focus on top ranked features that users want the most.


### Observation 4: Luca Nero
**Observation Statement:**
Most of our participants make their own playlists, so we will have to be careful in our attempt to mimic real personalization within playlist generation.

**Supporting Data:**  
- 75.86% of the respondents said they make their own playlists.
- Some of those who did **not** make their own playlists also mentioned that they relied on auto-generated playlists, so they may not be interested in our application at all.

**Team Action (if any):**  
We will have to observe actualy user generated playlists, and determine what makes the average person add a song to a playlist.
