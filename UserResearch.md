**Observation Statement:**
It is clear from our research that it will be very important that the app can generate reliably good playlists based on genre and mood.

**Supporting Data:**  
- 68.9% of users who took our survey stated genre and mood as being the most important filters for playlist generation
- It was stated in some comments that generated playlists typically cannot accurately match a mood which makes that filter more important to look into.
