# Net Promoter Score (NPS) Process

- **Periodically send out NPS surveys** to users, especially after key interactions like playlist generation or subscription renewal.

- **Ensure the survey is easy to access and complete**, possibly integrating it within the app for convenience.

- **Collect responses** and categorize them into:
  - **Promoters**: Scores of 9-10
  - **Passives**: Scores of 7-8
  - **Detractors**: Scores of 0-6

- **Calculate NPS**:
  - NPS = % of Promoters - % of Detractors

- **NPS Score Range**:
  - This score can range from -100 to 100.
